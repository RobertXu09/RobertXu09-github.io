          At this point in the class, I’ve worked a bit with Photoshop and other photo-editing 
          tools. I’ve also presented my Pecha Kucha, and I’ve seen a few other presentations, 
          so I have a better understanding of design now. For the assignments I’ve done so far 
          in the photo-editing unit, I have paid attention to learning multiple softwares, 
          applying concepts and techniques that are ubiquitous to photo-editing no matter the 
          software, and utilizing my own creativity to create content I want to make. 
        </p>

          For the first assignment of the unit, I parodied an old silverware ad by replacing 
          some of the silverware with baby utensils. The main purpose of this task was for me 
          to familiarize myself with using Photoshop and its tools. I’ve never used Photoshop 
          before, but I’ve used Gimp in the past to make very simple Facebook event banners and 
          I’ve used some drawing softwares to make art and comics. Coming in, I was familiar 
          with layers and the pencil and select tools, but that’s about it. To do this assignment 
          in Photoshop, I used some of Photoshop’s many functions, including the clone stamp tool. 
          I also played around with the RGB channels and filters to see if I wanted to make things 
          grayscale or not. It was an eye-opening task -- I realized that Photoshop is a very dense 
          software, and learning to use all of its functions would be time-consuming, but powerful.

          The next assignment of the unit was the genre-mixing movie poster. I was tasked to present 
          a horror movie as a documentary. Before even using any software, I analyzed different 
          documentary posters and compared them to horror movie posters. Documentaries are presented 
          in a much more grandiose and inspirational manner than I was expecting. Many seem to focus 
          on the event or person of interest and create an attention grabbing phrase to make learning 
          information about the documentary’s focus dramatic or interesting. Most of the fonts used are 
          clear and professional, as opposed to the round, bubbly comedic fonts or the sometimes gory 
          fonts of some horror movies. For my horror movie turned documentary, I chose Steven King’s 
          “The Shining”. To apply some of the documentary-esque elements I learned about, I chose a 
          professional-looking serif font, a dramatic scene capturing my subject interest, and added a 
          generic but intriguing tagline to foster curiosity about how a man is related to the paranormal.

          For assignment number three, I made a storyboard. For this task, I just used the Pecha Kucha 
          that I already presented, and wrote out my notes for my slides in the format of a storyboard. 
          To make my template, I created a layer in Gimp of just a box for me to have an idea of what to 
          put on a slide, and I had some lines to write my thoughts for what I would say during my 
          presentation. For each scene of the storyboard, I created a new layer to put my content on, 
          keeping the template visible and underneath.

          I really enjoyed the last assignment of the unit - the company logo. It is something I had 
          thought about already. I always wondered what would make a good concise logo, and how some logos 
          like Nike’s swoosh seem so fitting but abstract and simple. I also have always wanted to make a 
          webcomic, and I would want a logo for that project. I decided to use Krita for this project, an 
          open-source art software that emphasizes tools that are more drawing focused. It is one of the 
          software’s that I used to familiarize myself with using layers. For my logo, I tried to imagine 
          the vibe I wanted my comic to promote, which is derpy, cute, and silly. I then used a soft color 
          palette, big, round shapes, and a fun, doodle-esque font. I think if I were to edit it, I would 
          try something even simpler and more abstract for a logo.

          For my website, I most recently implemented the checklist. For my checklist, I used a table element, 
          but my table looked condensed and cramped. To solve this, I googled some css to create borders and 
          center the text within the table. As for the rest of the site, I decided I am actually pretty happy 
          with the design. It fits my art style, including my logo, and the text fits on the site better than 
          I expected. I feared adding paragraphs would make the site look messy, but centering the text and 
          constricting the width of the paragraph actually makes the content still look pretty clear. I cared 
          mostly about clarity on my site, and in my opinion my site still preserves my personality while 
          maintaining clarity.
