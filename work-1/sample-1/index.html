      <p>1 Star. If I could give this zero stars I would. This product is the biggest waste 
        of money I’ve ever spent my hard-earned cash on. I bought this for my baby kitten 
        Tibbers -- she’s adorable by the way, 6 months old, beautiful, orange fur, and the 
        cutest, tiniest paws... well anyway. So I buy this giant piece of trashright, more 
        than 60 dollars, and Tibbers doesn’t even use it! The description of the product 
        says cats will love it and she doesn’t. She hates it. She ignores it like I avoid 
        sin. She plays with the cardboard box instead. False advertising!!!I could get 
        some cardboard boxes for free if I wanted! I should sue this company for how they 
        lied about this product. I am absolutely fuming. Stay away!!!</p>
