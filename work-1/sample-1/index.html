      <p>1 Star. If I could give this zero stars I would. This product isthe biggest waste of money I’ve ever spent my hard-earned cash on. I bought this for my baby kitten Tibbers --she’s adorable by the way, 6 months old, beautiful, orange fur, and the cutest, tiniest paws... well anyway. So I buy this giant piece of trashright, more than 60 dollars, and Tibbers doesn’t even use it! The description of the product says cats will love it and she doesn’t. She hates it. She ignores it like I avoid sin. She plays with the cardboard box instead. False advertising!!!I could get some cardboard boxes for free if I wanted! I should sue this company for how they lied about this product. I am absolutely fuming. Stay away!!!</p>
