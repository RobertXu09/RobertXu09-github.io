      <h2>Work-1 Sample 2</h2>
      <p>I intend my website to be my personal site, where I can put my resume, experience, and projects. Most professional sites are clean and serious, but I don’t want mine to be like that. I am currently interested in game design/development and I really want my website to display a sense of my personality/creativity, so I’m thinking about approaching my website from that angle. </p>
      <p>The big dream for my site would be one where navigation of my site can be controlled with WASD or arrow keys to get a character to the links for different pages. Of course, I understand not everyone would be interested in that, so I’ll have to make it clear that simply clicking on links will work as well, or even make a button that transforms the site into a much more legible and simpler format. I’m envisioning a world in a style similarto Super Mario Bros 3 where all my links to subpages like resume, experience, and portfolio have a themed “door” of some sort. This is super ambitious or might even come out as a bad product, but I do want to attempt to make it happen. I have some experience making pixel art with a platform called Aseprite, and although I am not extremely well-versed with JS, I know basic syntax and I think I can google my way there. I can always fall back on just stylizing my pages as a retro game. I’m thinking of a bright, even cute, palette, and so I know I’ll have to pay extra attention to legibility.</p>
