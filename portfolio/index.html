      <h3>Soundscape</h3>

      <p>I had not played with audio much before this unit so this was a pretty interesting project. In my mind, I wanted to create a very mystical, magical scene. Visually, I imagined a forested area overlooking a running river, with a shimmering atmosphere with a bit of fog. I wanted someone experiencing that scene to feel solace and relaxation. To create the effect of nature, I looped different sounds of bugs and birds chirping and panned them to come from around the listener. I also panned a loop of rain sounds to make it sound like the listener was next to a river and could identify the direction it was coming from. For the sense of mystery, I remember adding a set of wings beating and a rustling of leaves that faded out, leaving the user wondering what that creature was.</p>
      <h3>Movie Poster</h3>
      <p>This project was meant to explore using Photoshop and the differences in genre. I was assigned to make a horror movie poster into the style of a documentary. I chose to use serious, typography and a dark blue tone. If I were to reimagine this work as a poster for a comedy, I would choose a goofy, rounded font with bright, bold colors. Viewers of this piece would instead recognize the style to be ridiculous and comedic. The more unfamiliar I expect my audience to be with the movie I chose, the more I would have to rely on common qualities found in comedies to make the genre register. If the audience knew the movie well, I could try a more subtle, ironic form of comedy.</p>
      <h3>Company Logo</h3>
      <p>I made my logo with the intention of giving viewers an impression that my comic was silly and doesn’t take itself seriously. To convey this, I used a round, thick, marker to write the text, and used bright pastel colors. The eyes on my character point in different directions and he has a stupefied expression on his face. If my comic were meant to be taken seriously, I’d use a darker, perhaps grayscale, color scheme and write the text with actual typeface instead of by hand. My character would also have a more serious expression and not look so stupid with its proportions.</p>
      <h3>Expectation Photoshop Project</h3>
      <p>To learn Photoshop, I took an old vintage ad for silverware and replaced some of the utensils with baby utensils. I was comparing the quality behind the fanciness of the advertised silverware and silliness of how baby utensils looked. Honestly, I thought it would just be funny. I think the revision would be better with the baby utensils being grayscale as well to better make them fit within the ad. I would also consider editing the text to exaggerate the quality of the silverware more to further pull the expectations of the advertised product from reality.</p>
      <h3>Storyboard</h3>
      <p>The storyboard took a long time to make, and I realized there were a few things that I could do to quicken the process. I laid the panels over a template and decided to type the text content instead of hand writing it. Even though the text didn’t lie directly on top of the lines, I don’t think the effort to move each line was worth the work, especially since the text is still legible. I learned that I should balance my time put into work based on its importance to the end product and its time required, especially when considering due dates.</p>
      <h3>Website</h3>
      <p>I’m pretty proud of my website. First, I put in a decent amount of work for qualities of the website that I believe give users an easier time. For example, based off of the user’s current page, I increase the font size in the header so the user knows where he or she is. Also, I’m proud of the aesthetic of the website. I think the color scheme and font are effective in conveying the feeling of comfiness I wanted. I don’t think the comic sans detracts from the clarity of the text either.</p>
      <h4>Reflection Essay</h4>
      <p>I enjoyed my time spent in this course over the last semester, and I believe I’ve left with both more practical skills in creating digital content as well as understanding how design can best convey content to an audience. I remember the first unit of the course, when I worked on the embedded fiction activity and my original website design idea. This part of the course introduced me to thinking about how the medium affects how an audience can receive the content, as well as how to start designing from the ground-up. I really appreciated the activity when we listed identifying words and feelings for different iconic characters and shows. Finding the core aspects and experience that I want my target audience to receive, then designing details to satisfy that intention, is something I’ve been trying to keep in mind for the rest of the projects in the course and my own. The following unit on image and audio editing taught me to design around my capabilities. Having a certain vision of my final product in mind then learning the tools I need to know to execute gave me direction in creating with software I wasn’t very familiar with. I also studied the work of others to influence how I can effectively create my own, such as during the genre-bent movie poster photoshop project. I will carry these lessons and techniques, along with new knowledge in universal principles of design, into my creating process for any future personal or professional projects.</p>
      <p>Regarding my writing process, I’ve always held high importance in envisioning my end product -- what it looks like, who it’s for, and what its purpose is. Over the course of this quarter, I built on top of this value with new awareness of how design and medium will affect these qualities. Rather than designing with specific features in mind, I will now start my creation process with defining my target audience and imagining the base impression I want my audience to have of my content. This will lead to the specifics in my design for a more cohesive and intentional product. I also have learned to place more importance in the iterative design process. I found throughout the projects in this semester that not only is my first pass not the best (obviously) but also that each iteration teaches me what design components work, what don’t, and what needs to be emphasized.</p>
      <p>When writing different genres, I always do my research for what are the defining qualities in each genre. I find examples of effective pieces of work and try to analyze what it is that consumers of the genre want. After defining what the goals of the genre are, I see what design choices communicate the core ideas. For example, for the comedic and satirical piece I did for my embedded fiction activity, I employed use of hyperbole and exaggerated speech patterns to emphasize the type of person I imagine my audience can relate to having met before. For my documentary-style movie poster, I used dim lighting for a sense of drama and intensity as well as a serif font that feels professional and serious. By looking at examples of the genre of work I make, I have a better understanding for the intention behind common design choices of the genre and am more able to emphasize their qualities.</p>
      <p>This term, my goal for this class was to be able to understand how to break down why and how media content I enjoy is designed and then be able to apply those concepts to my own projects. I am proud of the work I did this semester, but honestly what stands out most to me is learning the process of creation rather than my end products. I remember the difference in my thought process for when I first started thinking about how I wanted my website to be designed and my thought process for designing things now, and I’m proud of that shift in mentality. Thinking more from the target audience’s point of view and what I want my users to experience will drive a more directed design than a jumble of preplanned features. I will bring this methodology to my future projects and iterate over how my design choices successfully convey the intended core experience.</p>
      <p>There are multiple digital media projects I have interest in pursuing and applying what I’ve learned this semester. The first is to make a webcomic. Having learned about the affordances of different mediums, I’ll be aware that I should think about how comics use their frames and short blocks of text to display their content. Also, thinking about my intended audience and what they want can guide my style of comic. If I want to create for an audience interested in silly, ironic humor, my art will be purposely more scuffed. If I want to create for an audience that prefers cuter, wholesome content, my art will have a softer palette. Also, outside of thinking about my design choices, my creation process for comics will most likely involve a software with layers and tools like in Photoshop. The second project I have in mind for the future that will allow me to utilize the skills I learned over this course is to make some animations. For this project, I will be interested in character design which I’m sure the universal principles of design apply to. Right now, I’m thinking clarity and exaggeration to emphasize the characters’ core attributes. Audio editing will be useful here as well. And finally, I am interested in potentially creating a game. Game design will involve all of the above and more. In particular, I would spend a lot of time thinking about the user experience and what I want to be the main takeaway of the game. I no longer think I would make the mistake of jamming as many interesting game mechanics together. I’d be cognizant of how each aspect of the game contributes to the overall vision of the game.</p>
