      <h3>Soundscape</h3>
      <source src="../static/Soundscape.wav" type="audio/wav">
      <p>I had not played with audio much before this unit so this was a pretty interesting project. In my mind, I wanted to create a very mystical, magical scene. Visually, I imagined a forested area overlooking a running river, with a shimmering atmosphere with a bit of fog. I wanted someone experiencing that scene to feel solace and relaxation. To create the effect of nature, I looped different sounds of bugs and birds chirping and panned them to come from around the listener. I also panned a loop of rain sounds to make it sound like the listener was next to a river and could identify the direction it was coming from. For the sense of mystery, I remember adding a set of wings beating and a rustling of leaves that faded out, leaving the user wondering what that creature was.</p>
      <h3>Movie Poster</h3>
      <p>This project was meant to explore using Photoshop and the differences in genre. I was assigned to make a horror movie poster into the style of a documentary. I chose to use serious, typography and a dark blue tone. If I were to reimagine this work as a poster for a comedy, I would choose a goofy, rounded font with bright, bold colors. Viewers of this piece would instead recognize the style to be ridiculous and comedic. The more unfamiliar I expect my audience to be with the movie I chose, the more I would have to rely on common qualities found in comedies to make the genre register. If the audience knew the movie well, I could try a more subtle, ironic form of comedy.</p>
      <h3>Company Logo</h3>
      <p>I made my logo with the intention of giving viewers an impression that my comic was silly and doesn’t take itself seriously. To convey this, I used a round, thick, marker to write the text, and used bright pastel colors. The eyes on my character point in different directions and he has a stupefied expression on his face. If my comic were meant to be taken seriously, I’d use a darker, perhaps grayscale, color scheme and write the text with actual typeface instead of by hand. My character would also have a more serious expression and not look so stupid with its proportions.</p>
      <h3>Expectation Photoshop Project</h3>
      <p>To learn Photoshop, I took an old vintage ad for silverware and replaced some of the utensils with baby utensils. I was comparing the quality behind the fanciness of the advertised silverware and silliness of how baby utensils looked. Honestly, I thought it would just be funny. I think the revision would be better with the baby utensils being grayscale as well to better make them fit within the ad. I would also consider editing the text to exaggerate the quality of the silverware more to further pull the expectations of the advertised product from reality.</p>
      <h3>Storyboard</h3>
      <p>The storyboard took a long time to make, and I realized there were a few things that I could do to quicken the process. I laid the panels over a template and decided to type the text content instead of hand writing it. Even though the text didn’t lie directly on top of the lines, I don’t think the effort to move each line was worth the work, especially since the text is still legible. I learned that I should balance my time put into work based on its importance to the end product and its time required, especially when considering due dates.</p>
      <h3>Website</h3>
      <p>I’m pretty proud of my website. First, I put in a decent amount of work for qualities of the website that I believe give users an easier time. For example, based off of the user’s current page, I increase the font size in the header so the user knows where he or she is. Also, I’m proud of the aesthetic of the website. I think the color scheme and font are effective in conveying the feeling of comfiness I wanted. I don’t think the comic sans detracts from the clarity of the text either.</p>
