          So far, for the assignments I’ve done for Composing Digital Media, I’ve focused on 
          making content that both adequately expresses the design concepts I’ve learned in 
          class and proudly portrays my own personality and personal taste in designs. I am 
          currently still very happy with my Embedded Fiction Activity. I think it does 
          effectively satirize the overly personal and unfairly critical comments I’ve seen 
          in some customer reviews. However, for my original Design Concept Activity, I do 
          think my vision has changed.
        </p>
        <p>       
          I have a lot of conflicting ideas for how I might want my coursework website to be 
          designed. On my original write-up, I was considering a site themed after Super Mario 
          Bros. I liked the concept of each page being a different world, with the navigation 
          being done with a series of doors. Ambitiously, I also wanted my site to be able to 
          be navigated with arrow keys or WASD, like a real platformer game. I figured it would 
          be fitting for me, in both showcasing programming skills and fun pixel art. I wanted 
          my site to be memorable, impressive, and fun. Unfortunately, having done some work 
          and reconsidered how I want my website to be, I do not think I can fulfill my original 
          design vision. In the future, I might host a WebGL Unity game on a website to have a 
          fun interactable resume. I think that would be really cool, but not a project for now 
          and for this class.

          I really liked the activity we did in class where we took inspiration from popular 
          fictional characters. I chose Calvin and Hobbes. Having gained the insight that I can 
          pick out certain ‘vibes’ that I want my website to emanate, I now have a few ideas 
          I want to portray. They do seem somewhat difficult to mesh together though, so I might 
          end up continuing to change my site up a lot to prioritize some design concepts at 
          the expense of others. First, I like the simplicity, intimacy, and “home-growned-ness” 
          of Calvin and Hobbes. I considered having finding some fonts that look like pen strokes, 
          as well as having a white or very light gray background color in order to give the 
          feeling of ink on printer paper. I also wanted to put some doodles (that I haven’t made yet)
          that fit that Sunday newspaper comic strip style. This concept obviously clashed with the 
          Super Mario Bros. concept, which requires a fully fleshed, brightly colored, and painstakingly 
          detailed world to create what I think is an experience worthy of the Nintendo game. I am 
          considering putting in some splashes of pixel art icons instead of inked doodles to give 
          create a feeling of not-so-serious nostalgia and quirkiness. However, neither of these 
          design inspirations are at the forefront of my current iteration of my website. I am 
          very seriously considering transitioning to either concept later.

          My current website is designed with the essence of a doodle I made a bit of time ago. 
          It’s a characterized doodle of myself wrapped up in my blanket, with a pink hoodie and 
          headphones on, and sleeping next to a mug of hot chocolate. It’s drawn in a very Chibi 
          style, with a disproportionately large head, round features, and tiny limbs. I’d say it’s 
          a very cute style. The colors I used are pastel – soft, bright, and friendly. Since I 
          knew I wanted a drawing on my homepage, and that this drawing would be the one at least 
          for now, I decided to design my website around it. First, the colors I used are from a 
          similar palette. The navigation bar is a similar shade of salmon as my blanket, and I chose 
          a light-yellow background color that I feel is as soft as my drawing. The text is in Comic 
          Sans, which I feel really complements the cutesy, soft, and rounded nature of the doodle. 
          My About Me text is as simple and friendly as I could write it. I don’t think a long-winded, 
          detailed text fits the casual vibe of the site. The top left corner is my name, because I 
          know most viewers will prioritize looking there according to what I’ve learned in class. I 
          wrote “Rob” instead of “Robert” since I think the shortened name is more casual. The 
          navigation bar has links that are centered in the middle of the bar by height to be more 
          pleasing to the eye, and are spaced out evenly. For the sake of clarity, the current page 
          that the viewer is on is bolded in the navigation bar. Also, I centered the drawing on my 
          site since I place high importance in it – after all, I designed this current iteration of 
          the site around it.

          There are many areas of growth that I am interested in being introduced to or improving in. 
          I want to become familiar with storyboarding, since I am currently learning to draw with the 
          goal that one day, I can animate something. I also hope to become proficient at Photoshop. 
          I’ve used Gimp before at a very surface level, and I am familiar with using layers, but I know 
          there are many tools that I am unfamiliar with provided by Photoshop. I am also very interested 
          in the design philosophy behind designing a good logo. And finally, I wish to continue to learn 
          about web design and become more familiar with HTML and CSS to better implement the things I 
          learn about design.
